# JavaMp3Organizer
Java application that scans your computer in search of potentially duplicated mp3 songs by using original search algorithms to look at names, sizes and duration, applying different levels of "possible duplicates". The application generates a report so the user can look up the files and listen/delete them.
## Running Java Applications from .jar Archives
To run the Java applications from the .jar (Java Archive) file, follow these steps:

### Download the .jar Archive:
Visit the GitHub repository where the Java applications are stored. Locate the .jar file you want to execute and click on the "Download" button to save it to your local machine.

### Ensure Java is Installed:
Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) or Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system. To check if Java is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:

java -version

If Java is installed, you should see the version information. If not, you'll need to download and install Java from the official Java website.

### Open Terminal or Command Prompt:
Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer. The steps may vary depending on your operating system.

### Navigate to the .jar File:
Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you downloaded the .jar file. For example, if the file is located in the Downloads folder, use the following command (modify it according to your file's actual location):

cd Downloads

Execute the .jar File: Run the Java application by executing the .jar file using the java command. Use the following syntax:

java -jar <filename>.jar

Replace <filename> with the actual name of the .jar file. For example, if your file is named myapp.jar, the command would be:

java -jar myapp.jar

### Application Execution:
The Java application should now start running, and you should see the output or user interface, if any, depending on the specific application.
